# Catch-Darla
Catch Darla Game.
This is my first app project I started making 2 weeks into learning html/css. It's based on my dog Darla and how fast she is. I was attempting for 
the user to try to "catch" Darla (represented by a couple of black divs)by hovering over her with the grab cursor,but she would move too fast in order to actually click on her. It's not 100 percent yet, but I wanted to at least get the main concept down, then tweak it later with the more concepts I learn.
